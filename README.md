# Huffman Coding Implementation in C

This C program implements the Huffman coding algorithm, a widely used method for data compression. It demonstrates the creation of Huffman trees and the encoding and decoding processes to compress and decompress text data.

## Features

- Implementation of Huffman trees.
- Functions for initializing, manipulating, and traversing Huffman trees and lists.
- Data compression and decompression using Huffman coding.

## Requirements

To compile and run this program, you need a C compiler such as GCC installed on your system.

## Compilation

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing `Huffman.c` and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc Huffman.c -o Huffman
```

This will generate an executable named `Huffman`.

## Usage

After compilation, you can run the program using:

```bash
./Huffman
```

Please note that the current version of the program may require modifications to add specific functionality for reading input data and displaying or saving the compressed and decompressed outputs.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the implementation or extend the features are welcome. Please feel free to fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
